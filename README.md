- 👋 Hi, I’m @Anoiki
- 👀 I’m interested in codes I can implement for 3D modeling and engineering. I'm an artist, sculptor and 3D designer so anyhthing that can be helpful in that field.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning about latent spaces generative differential growth, fibonacci spirals and morphogenesis.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on projects that deal with generative art, biological formations, procedural and parametric generation of sculptural forms, organic, geometric and architectural
